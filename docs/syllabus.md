## Course Description

The landscape of computation platforms has changed dramatically in recent years. Android-powered smartphones are widely available to millions of users. New gadgets such as Google Glass, Leap Motion, and Oculus Rift promote interesting human-computer interactions, with rich programmability support. Multi-core CPUs, and CUDA-enabled GPUs are commonly deployed in computer systems. Computing devices such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are on the horizon. Programming on these emerging platforms remains a challenging task. This course introduces a number of state-of-the-art programming models on these platforms, and further explores the frontier of next-generation programming language design that may potentially impact the future programming practice for emerging platforms. In particular, the course investigates Android programming, multi-core programming, GPGPU programming, and UAV programming, with additional presentations on other platforms on the rise. Applications of these programming models range from high-performance computing, games, real-time systems, cyber-physical systems, to energy-conscious systems. 

## Prerequisite

CS 140: Programming with Objects  
CS 240: Data Structures and Algorithms  
CS 320: Computer Architecture  

CS476 assumes students are familiar with:
1. Programming in a high-level language such as Java, C or C++
2. Basic concepts and components of computer architecture

## Course Objectives

This course is designed to expose advanced computer science students to new programming technologies and software development methodologies on emerging platforms. Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:
- Understand the constraints and opportunities associated with each emerging platform
- Use critical thinking to evaluate the pros and cons of emerging technologies
- Learn basic skills for programming smartphones, multi-core CPUs, GPUs, and UAVs
- Implement a project with a theme on pervasive computing in the connected world 

## Main Topics

* Classic Multi-Core Programming
  * Pthreads, Low-level Synchronization 
  * Cilk
  * Java Threads, ForkJoin 
* Multi-Core Programming in Go
  * Channels, Non-shared memory model
* GPU Programming
  * CUDA / OpenCL
* Android Programming
  * Android Basics
  * Sensor Management (Accelerometer, GPS etc.)
  * Dalvik / Android Run Time (ART)
  * React / React Native
* UAV Programming
  * Paparazzi 
* Additional topics if time permits

## Grading

### Criteria

You grade will be based on:
- Programming Assignments (50%)
- Semester Project (25%)
- Final Exam (15%)
- Participation (10%)

### Assignments

Programming assignments will regularly be given, and are meant to reinforce topics taught and worked on in class. Expect 4-5 throughout the semester. In terms of lines of code, the assignment will be relatively short, however, as we will move through several topics throughout the semester, expect the assignments to be challenging in terms of using new frameworks, programming models, and techniques for each emerging platform.

### Project

Each of you will work on a capstone project that showcases an emerging technology / platform of your choosing. You will select a language, framework, or platform and meet with me to discuss a minimal working example that demonstrates knowledge of the selected topic. I will provide a list of potential options and aid in selecting a topic if you are unsure of what interests you. We will select topics in March, and students will give me a final demo in early May.

### Attendance

Class attendance is mandatory. Each student is allowed two *unexcused* absences. Think of this as weeks worth of vacation time (2 classes). As far as excused absences, please contact me *prior* to missing class. I reserve the right to approve / disprove excused absences (with the exception of religious holidays) on an individual basis. Excused absences include, but are not limited too, religious holidays, injury or illness, sick family member etc.

More than two unexcused absences will results in a half lowering of final grade, i.e., dropping a B to a B-. 

### Final Exam

We will have an exam during finals week. The bulk of your grade will come from work done during the semester. The final will be given in a way that rewards this effort, rather then pile on top of it. Further details to be given later on in the semester.

### Participation

I favor an interactive teaching style where I will work on and have you work on programming problems during class, when applicable. As a result, participating in class is a natural extension of attending for everyone, and the participation grade is meant to reward you for attending and working during class.

### Academic Honesty Expectations

Please review the academic honesty document and make sure that you understand it! The link is at:  [http://www.binghamton.edu/watson/about/honesty-policy.pdf](http://www.binghamton.edu/watson/about/honesty-policy.pdf). Cheating and copying will NOT be tolerated. Each assignment must be completely individually.
